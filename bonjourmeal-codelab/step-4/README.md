# Bonjour Meal Django Python starter code - Step 4

This repository is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project
for an app on Google's Business Messages. It demonstrates an integration with the
payment processor Stripe. If you follow the Buy Online Pick Up in store Codelab
Part 3, you should arrive at the changes here in Step 4.

You can find the [Business Messages codelab here](http://codelabs.developers.google.com/)
which walks you through the process of extending the shopping experience built
in the previous Codelab (Part 2 of the Buy Online Pickup In Store) to integrate
with the aforementioned payment processor.

The sample can be adapted to your infrastructure, enabling you to launch a
Business Messages experience to engage customers in social commerce with your
company.

# Codelab tutorial
See our [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) tutorial for
instructions on how to deploy the application and interact with the
conversational surface through Business Messages.
